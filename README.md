# BeMyEyes
Repository for BeMyEyes, game being developed for the Video Game Design and Programming course at POLIMI 

The game is an online multiplayer game developed in Unity and built for Android. The main ideia is that two players have to cooperate in an assymetric experience. While one player has control over the game elements (driving a car, clicking in buttons, ...) the other player has the whole information on screen (where the obstacles are, which button is the right one to be clikced, ...). They have to communicate in an efficient way to get the highest score in the minigames avaible.
